### features

* completely seamless
    * nifty pre / post class setup code means you don't have to make repetitive `super()` calls.
    * focus on signals + hooks to help avoid having to write shitty code in your subclasses.
* enables and promotes the healthy use of `url_for` instead of hard coding url paths.
    * boom, less brittle code.
    * oddly, there's a lot of things that go wrong out of the box with this, so funktional removes all of this shity setup code from your actual test code.
* test file uploads in flask applications. right ouf of the box.
    * perfect for your [shitty] little csv uploader tools.
* cross platform
    * works in any standard python flask application + platform, such as amazon or google app engine.
